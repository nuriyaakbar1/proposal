## 1\. Project Overview

This project is the development of a responsive e-commerce website for **ProSport Hub**, a South African retailer of sports equipment, footwear, and apparel.The goal is to create a modern, user-friendly online store that enhances product discovery, simplifies the shopping experience, and increases online sales.

This repository contains the core HTML files for the website, structured according to the business proposal prepared by Nuriya Akbar.



## 2\. Key Features

The website includes the following pages and features based on the project plan:

  * **Homepage (`index.html`):** The main landing page to welcome users.
  * **About Us Page (`about.html`):** Contains the company's history, mission, and vision.
  * **Products Page (`product.html`):** A dynamic product catalog that displays items using JavaScript. Features include:
      * Grid-based layout for product cards.
      * "Add to Cart" functionality using `localStorage`.
      * Descriptive overlay on hover.
  * **Navigation:** A consistent navigation bar allows users to access all main sections of the site, including Home, About, Enquiry, Contact, Products, and the Shopping Cart.



## 3\. Technology Stack

The project is built using foundational web technologies as outlined in the proposal:

  * **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
  * **CSS3:** For styling and layout (currently implemented as internal CSS in each file).
  * **JavaScript:** For dynamic functionality, such as rendering products and managing the shopping cart on the `product.html` page.

  * `index.html`
  * `about.html`
